# Indentation
- Four spaces should be used as the unit of indentation. 
- The exact construction (spaces vs. tabs) is unspecified.
- Tabs must be set exactly every 8 spaces (not 4).

## Line Length
Avoid lines longer than 80 characters, reason- since they are not handled well by many terminals and tools.

*Note: Examples for use in documentation should have a shorter line length, generally no more than 70 characters.*

## Wrapping Lines
When an expression will not fit on a single line, break it according to these general principles:
- Break after a comma.
- Break before an operator.
- Prefer higher-level breaks to lower-breaks.
- Align the new line with the beginning of the expression at the same level on the previous line.
- If the above rules lead to confusing code or to code that's squished up against the right margin, just indent 8 spaces instead.
